## Phase 0: Game Selection, Analysis & Plan

#### Selected Game: Breakout/Arkanoid

### Necessary Features
What are the core features that your game should have? These should be things that __must__ be implemented in order to make the game playable, not extra features that could be added to make the game more fun to play.

Three different objects that represent the player controlled paddle, a ball, and the layers of bricks. The ball should bounce off the paddle and walls and break the bricks when in contact. When the ball falls to the bottom of the screen past the paddle it resets but the bricks remain the same and the game continues. 

### Extra Features
What are some features that are not essential to gameplay, but you would like to see (provided you have time after completing the necessary features.

### Classes
What classes will you be creating for this project? Include the instance variables and methods that you believe you will need. You will be required to create at least 2 different classes. If you are going to use classes similar to those we've made for previous assingments, you will have to add new features to them.
